<p>A paragraph consists of one or more sentences
 that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The
 start of a paragraph is indicated by a new
 line.</p>
<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up
 into units of text. For example, a book may have
 chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
 each heading there will be one or more
 paragraphs.</p>
